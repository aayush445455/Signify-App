# Signify - A Real-Time ASL Interpreter App ðŸ¤Ÿ

Signify is an innovative mobile application designed to bridge the communication gap between the hearing majority and the deaf and hard-of-hearing community. This app uses advanced computer vision and machine learning on consumer mobile devices to provide real-time American Sign Language (ASL) interpretation. It converts ASL gestures into legible text and synthesized speech, fostering accessible, two-way communication.
